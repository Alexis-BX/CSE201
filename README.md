# Not Mario Bros
 Not Mario Bros project’s aim is to create a game similar to, well, Mario Bros, using our own graphics and ideas (for example, we might have different power-ups, characters, sets, etc.). We are going to divide the team into two categories: graphics (GUI & art) and engine. We will also have a git responsible and two game designers (one from the graphics group and one from the back-end group).  
Not Mario Bros project’s aim is to create a game similar to, well, Mario Bros, using our own graphics and ideas (for example, we might have different power-ups, characters, sets, etc.). We will use a parisian theme: our background will have the Eiffel Tower and other known buildings, Mario is going to be a mime with a beret, etc. We are going to divide the team into two categories: graphics (GUI & art) and engine. We will also have a git responsible and two game designers (one from the graphics group and one from the back-end group).  
 <strong>Graphics:</strong> Hiba, Maria, Mamoun, Alexis (<em>leader</em>) <br>
<strong>Engine:</strong> Konstantinos, Sebastian (<em>leader</em>), Khoa, Agathe, Adrien, Xinyi, Clara <br>
