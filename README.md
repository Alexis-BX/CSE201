# CSE201

Mario Bros projectâ€™s aim is to create a game similar to, well, Mario Bros, using our own graphics and ideas (for example, we might have different power-ups, characters, sets, etc.). We are going to divide the team into two categories: graphics (GUI & art) and engine. We will also have a git responsible and two game designers (one from the graphics group and one from the back-end group).  

Graphics: Hiba, Maria, Mamoun, Alexis (leader)
Engine: Konstantinos, Sebastian (leader), Khoa, Agathe, Adrien, Xinyi, Clara
Git leader: Khoa
